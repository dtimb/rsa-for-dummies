# rsa-for-dummies
My attempt at recreating rsa encryption with C and Python

# Use via command line / terminal:
command would look like this:
 - python3 main.py --encrypt --infile "name of file you want to encrypt" --outfile "name of encrypted file"
 - or
 - python3 main.py -e -i "name of file you want to encrypt" -o "name of encrypted file"
 - 
 - python3 main.py --decrypt --infile "name of file you want to decrypt" --outfile "name of decrypted file"
 - or
 - python3 main.py -d -i "name of file you want to decrypt" -o "name of decrypted file"
